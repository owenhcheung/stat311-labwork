# Question 1
```{r}
# a)

# b)
a = 0.01
# H0: difference in means is 0, Ha: difference in means is not 0
test = (23.12 - 17.90) - 0
# 5.22
test2 = sqrt((5.01^2 / 27) + (2.28^2 / 21))
# 1.084978
t = test / test2
# t statistic = 4.81116
df = min((27-1), (21-1))
# df = 20
pval <- pt(q = 4.81116, df = 20)
# p val = 0.9999469
# p value is large so we do not reject H0 the data does not provide convincing evidence that suggests the difference in mean sick days between blue collar workers and white collars workers is not 0
```

# Question 2
```{r}
n <- 12
#confidence interval of 95% for mean is (46.2, 56.9)

# a) what is the margin of error for this confidence interval
ME <- (56.9 - 46.2) / 2
ME
# margin of error = 5.35

# b) what is the point estimate for that sample
# finding sample mean
samp_mean <- 56.9 - ME
samp_mean
# sample mean = 51.55

# c) find the standard deviation for that sample
# 95% = 2 SDs away from mean
SD <- (56.9 - 46.2) / 4
SD
# standard deviation = 2.675

```

# Question 3
```{r}

# Question 4
```{r}

# Question 5
```{r}
handout1 <- read.csv("data/Handout 1.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(handout1)
grouped <- handout1 %>%
  group_by(SEX) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(SALARY), list(mean_salary = mean))
grouped
# seems like a difference in means question
# hypothesis
# H0: no difference, Ha: difference
